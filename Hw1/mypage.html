        <h1>Peters, Alison</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Loveland, CO. I am a senior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering.
        I have had two summer internships: one at a company that makes printer ink and one at a company that
        makes gene therapy medication. I am currently a course assistant for a heat transfer class.
        I am studying computer science as a minor because I enjoy programming and I think it's a really
        applicable skill to my future career path.</p>
